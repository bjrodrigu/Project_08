Campus Location Rating & Review Application - Walking Skeleton

Introduction

This is the initial version of the campus rating and review application, focusing on setting up the basic structure with minimal functionality. The goal of the walking skeleton is to create a fully connected system that involves the backend, frontend, and database, ensuring that all parts of the system are working together.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Frontend: React
Database: MySQL
Map Integration: Google Maps API (to be implemented later)

Features (Walking Skeleton):
For this project’s walking skeleton, users should be able to view a list of campus locations along with their associated rating. Additionally, users should be able to leave their own rating and have it updated in the location’s overall score. 

This serves as a foundation to build on while ensuring that each part of the system is connected and working together.
