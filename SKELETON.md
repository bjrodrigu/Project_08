Campus Location Rating & Review Application - Walking Skeleton

Introduction

This is the initial version of the campus rating and review application, focusing on setting up the basic structure with minimal functionality. The goal of the walking skeleton is to create a fully connected system that involves the backend, frontend, and database, ensuring that all parts of the system are working together.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Frontend: React
Database: MySQL
Map Integration: Google Maps API (to be implemented later)

Features (Walking Skeleton):
Basic Spring Boot backend that serves a simple "Hello, World!" message.
React frontend displaying a hardcoded list of campus locations.
MySQL database setup with a simple `locations` table and basic CRUD functionality (create and read).
A simple API that connects the backend to the frontend.

This serves as a foundation to build on while ensuring that each part of the system is connected and working together.
